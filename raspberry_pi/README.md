# Raspberry Pi Setup Scripts

This directory is a placeholder for scripts that will be used to prepare a Raspberry Pi for use in the Kubernetes cluster.

The workflow will be similar to that of the `jetson_orin` setup, transforming a stock Raspberry Pi OS installation into a hardened, headless server ready to be assigned a cluster role.
