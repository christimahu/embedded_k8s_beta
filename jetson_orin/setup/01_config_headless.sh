#               Step 1: Jetson Headless Configuration (01_config_headless.sh)
#
# ====================================================================================
#
#  Purpose:
#  --------
#  This is the FIRST script to run on a freshly imaged Jetson device that is
#  booted from the microSD card. It automates all the essential "Day 0" setup
#  tasks to transform the device from a desktop machine into a hardened, headless
#  server ready for the next setup stage.
#
#  Tutorial Goal:
#  --------------
#  This script handles the foundational preparation of a physical machine for a
#  cluster. We will configure the network for stability, minimize the OS for
#  security and performance, and disable features that are incompatible with
#  Kubernetesâ€”all prerequisites for a stable cluster environment.
#
#  Workflow:
#  ---------
#  1. Boot a new Jetson from a freshly flashed microSD card.
#  2. Complete the initial on-screen Ubuntu setup.
#  3. Clone this repository onto the device.
#  4. Run this script: `sudo ./setup/01_config_headless.sh`
#

# A Kubernetes cluster is a distributed system where nodes must reliably
# communicate. If a node's IP address changes (as can happen with default DHCP
# settings), the control plane loses contact, marking the node as "NotReady" and
# disrupting workloads. By assigning a permanent, static IP, we ensure each node
# has a stable, predictable address for the lifetime of the cluster. This is a
# fundamental requirement for any server in a cluster.

# --- Tutorial: Disabling Swap Memory for Kubernetes ---

# RAM, makes this accounting unpredictable. If a pod uses swap, its performance
# becomes erratic. The kubelet is designed to enforce memory limits strictly; if
# a pod exceeds its memory, it should be terminated and restarted, not allowed to
# slow down the whole system by using disk swap.
